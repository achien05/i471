;; *RESTRICTIONS*:
;;
;; YOU WILL RECEIVE A SUBSTANTIAL PENALTY (INCLUDING POSSIBLY A ZERO)
;; FOR THIS PROJECT IF YOU VIOLATE THE FOLLOWING RESTRICTIONS:
;;
;; You cannot use any destructive operations (operations which end
;; with a ! like set!).
;;
;; You cannot use a named-let
;;   (<https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/let.html#(part._.Named_let)>).
;;
;; You may only use the built-in Scheme functions mentioned in
;; class or in this project, including the following:
;;   The arithmetic functions +, -, *, /, expt
;;     ((expt a n) = a^n; (expt 2 5) = 32.
;;   The boolean functions and, or, not.
;;   The relational predicates on numbers: <, >, <=, >= and =.
;;   The equality predicate 'eq? to check equality.
;;   Any of Racket's list functions
;;   (<https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/pairs.html>).
;;   In particular, length, list, list-ref, memf, pair?, range, reverse,
;;   map, fold[lr]. 
;; 

;; *TESTS*:
;;
;; Initially, calls to all the test functions have been commented out
;; (at the bottom of the prj2-tests.scm file).  Activate each call as
;; you implement the corresponding function.
;;
;; If a particular function is going into an infinite loop on any
;; test, submit your attempted code for that function under a
;; different function name so that it is not run as part of the
;; automated tests but your looping code can still be evaluated.
;; Submit the original function in its 'TODO state. This will stop the
;; looping test from preventing subsequent tests from running.  Add a
;; comment specifying which test causes your code to loop.
